    "text": "Ordinary People are Evil: and this from a very simple argumentation. It’s our moral duty to donate to charity the money otherwise spent on luxury.\nPeter-Singer’s argument begins with the premise that we have a moral duty to assist in solving very bad problems, provided that we are capable of doing so. Are famine and poverty very bad things? Then you see where this is going.\nDonating to charity serves as proxy for solving these very bad things — and, if it’s so easy to donate to them, why we choose, over and over again, to buy a cup of expensive coffee, or buy a car, or anything superfluous?\nThis is hard to refute. I could say that spending money as we see fit doesn’t make the average citizen evil: evil is the underlying system that coerces us to do so — a system which was not designed with this moral duty in mind.\nWhat if superfluous things do serve a purpose? They often signalize power — think designer items — and might serve as a ‘social boost’ for the individual to eventually earn more. By earning more he is objectively more powerful when performing this moral duty.\nShould this moral duty be seem as accumulative or be exercised daily to be fulfilled? Consider the example of a rich guy who never donate a single cent to charity, but just before he dies he distribute his whole wealth to charity institutions.\nOne could make the case that our moral duty is to accumulate the maximum possible wealth — to fulfill one’s wealth potential — enabling the donation of bigger sums in the future. See Earning to give.\nTo make the example even more morally complex, let us assume the rich guy has done so, not because of his moral duty, but by pure spite of his sons neglecting him in the adulthood. The donation was more a moral lesson to his sons than a fulfillment of his moral duties.\nIs the moral duty in our internal perception or in the sum objectively donated? Or in both?\nThese are the sort of questions I ask myself when translating the argument to our society. I do think is important to exercise frugality independent of social status. But how much to do while keeping oneself motivated, interesting and sane in the society? Luxury is also sometimes hard to detect — there are brands whose line between utility and luxury is blurred, hence what I often catch myself saying: “it’s more expensive, but I trust the brand X and I know it will probably last way longer than the cheaper one from brand Y.”\nThe line is so blurred that the perceived qualities of a given brand — a maintainable, reliable, durable product — are used as justification for its luxury. How far do theses supposedly quality attributes cover its higher price is up to debate.\n“I justify drinking this fancy light-roasted Nicaragua coffee brewed using my ceramic v60 because, seriously, without coffee I can’t even start working.” This one hits home. Can I justify spending 10 times what some people have to eat in a fancy coffee so the gentleman me can start working… from home?\nThese are part of what I call hobby-spendings; the money I spent upgrading my mini recording studio belongs to this same category. They are definitely an exercise of luxury: I didn’t have to spend the amount I did. But does this make me evil?\nIn some sense, yes. However, hobbies provide me purpose and help me stay sane. These are arguably important functions; therefore, when we perceive the whole picture, an unmotivated me wouldn’t earn as much money as a motivated me. Is it then my fault that I need these little escapisms from daily life in order to properly function in society? Should I carry the moral burden of not fulfilling this moral duty alone? Or did society make me evil, or by society being evil am I bound to also be?\nThese are attempts of justification; but they are weak. Had I donated the money I spent in hobbies, society would have been better off — with the cost of me being a more uninteressant and unmotivated person. Is it a fair price to pay? Or is there a limit — a common sense limit — of how much you can spend in hobbies and still be morally fair?\nCurrently I draw the line based on a hobby enjoyment utility: if the purchase helps me enjoy the hobby more, then I justify spending more money on it. I know, I know, it’s so easy to game this artificial line, “Oh, I need one more guitar because.. because.. this one never goes out of tune! So I can use the time practicing and not tuning it!” Clearly a luxury-driven purchase I would say. Or maybe not? “hear me out, player X uses this guitar and listen to it for a second: it’s amazing. How can I even start recording my songs without having it?” Stop!\n“I’ll buy jacket X because it protects me good against wind and cold. It costs more but I’ll be warm for the average 10 min per day I stay outside in the winter.”\n“Oh look. That game is in sale in Steam! Let us buy it so we can play together for 2 hours and never touch it again.”\n“I’ll gladly pay a bit more for this mayo, because the other tastes a bit odd.”\nWe have the luxury of spending money so freely; should we relinquish that and live as frugal as possible? Or should we delegate the moral burden to society? Or should we just take part in consumerism and live as usual — since it keep us sane?\nPledges like Giving What We Can or Earning to give are incomplete realizations of Effective altruism as proposed by Singer. They tackle the issue from the monetary perspective, but not from the internal agent perspective. Frugality can be a consequence of taking the pledge, but not instrumental for it.\nAnother aspect is how different is to donate to a charity and to donate to, let’s say, your mother who is in need? Why choose your mother, who let’s assume is not in risk of famine due to her support net, but need the money to sustain herself and be motivated? Is that a luxury spending — spending in your mother so that she can live better instead of spending to solve world famine?\nSolving these very bad issues is a shared moral burden, which are best solved bottom-up one could argue. Does this legitimizes conquering countries whose management are inefficient in tackling the basic subsistent needs of the population? Crazy to think about this, that even war could be legitimized by this simple thinking exercise.\nWhen we maximize one goal and forget about others — or the context where the goal is to be pursued — we get into the risk of the genie effect: there are many paths to realize a given goal, but the genie likes to fulfill the wish while also maximizes suffering for the wisher. I know, this is not to say that society would act as a genie; but it could! It’s a possibility one can’t ignore.\nTo completely delegate the moral burden to society is to float in the waves of its decisions. An inert life full of soma-like acceptance.\nMorally just, morally incorrect."

    "text": "Procedure\n\nContinuous research is composed by three main process: inputting, consolidating and reviewing.\nInputting (or ingesting) describes the acquisition of information or sources. It must be as friction-less as possible.\ntransforms the raw content in atomic content pieces that are relevant to you. These are going to be referred as just inputs.\nHere is where the annotation process happens. When you find anything relevant, quote it and add to input with a reference to the original source. Add also your comments in the same fashion.\nIf your preferred way of discovering content is using a phone, use the tools native to its OS to do the job. If you rather use an analogical notebook to do so, then do it.\nIf you input a source — like a paper for reading later — it stays in the ingesting queue for a second round; it must be converted to its inputs\nAfter the information is ingested it must be consolidated. Consolidation is the process of integrating the result of the previous step into the Second-Brain.\nWhenever an input is integrated, it should be archived, in order to not clutter the input backlog. What is archiving depends on how the ingesting platform was implemented. For example, in Google Keep there’s an easy swipe-to-the-right action which archives a note. For a notebook, this could be achieved by crossing or tearing a page out.\nThis step also marks the consolidated pieces of information for review or not with the goal of achieving Incremental-Reading.\nThis step appends and/or connects the pieces of information with existing Evergreen notes\nReviewing happens only with the base of the already consolidated notes.\nHere techniques for improving recalling can be utilized: Spaced-Repetition, Incremental-Reading\nCombining the execution process with Work-Session, we arrive at Consolidation-Session, Review-Session, Input-Session"

    "text": "Today I found out I have a really shallow understanding of Anarchism. It’s the same old thing over and over: we think we have a minimum understanding of a topic — enough to know about when someone’s talking about it — but we actually have a nuanced view of it from school, friends or you name it.\nIt might be enough to understand what your local ancap friend is speaking, but not nearly scrapping the tip of the iceberg of all the collective thought that was put on this project.\nIt’s just this illusion of having at least a small understanding of it that bothers me a lot — where all this confidence in my beliefs come from? Out of nowhere, out of blue.\nI’m not saying I am proponent of anarchism — I mean, I just said I barely understand it — but I see the value in having the discussion and understanding where the thinkers are coming from. People way smarter than me dealt with this issues and arrived at the conclusion that this way of seeing things could fit the world better. It could be a solution to the failed project we live in.\nOnce again, my one-sided friend of this Digital-Panopticon, Stephen West from Philosophize-This! spoke to me closely — around 1.5 hours, during my last failed attempt of a half marathon.1\nI set up his 4 episodes about anarchism and had the goal of understanding it at least a bit better.\nI’ll start with the last thing I remember: what I understood so far about anarchism was actually Anarcho-Capitalism. But more on this later.\nI should be careful when defining each of these terms. He explains it’s sometimes hard for the proponents to agree on definitions and the core principles around anarchism. This is a feature and not a bug: this “free” way of thinking leads naturally to less constrains on the terminology. The disagreements are often in the implementation details; however they could also emerge from completely different schools of thought: basing the mediation device on the market opposed to the human, for example."

The Representative-Democracy should justify itself for its continued existence; or less abstractly, the major of your city: he should also have to justify his position of power.\nThis makes sense to me; why collectively pay somebody to sit there and do things that neither his peers nor he throughly understands! Managing such a complex system, with thousand, hundred thousands, millions of people is simply impossible. To have people with such a strong concentrated responsibility (and privileges) boggles the mind.\nTheir answer? A bottom-up Federated-Society based on Direct-Democracy. Groups of people with similar interests form naturally — and it makes sense for each interested party to be able to decide matters that impact them (and opt out from matters that are irrelevant to them)\nThese groups can become part of larger federations if they choose to. But the key distinction is the flexibility: they can opt-out easily when the conditions are not beneficial anymore.\nThey can also “lend” power to someone chosen to represent the group. He is, however, merely a proxy to the opinions of the group — since votes are casted directly and not being decided by the head of it. The flexible opt-out mechanism behaves similarly here: if the person is not adequately representing the group anymore, he can be removed from the position.\nPeople argue that this horizontal organization emerges naturally from humans. Things start to go south, however, when societies grow bigger. The illusion is then sold to us, that we need to rely on bigger and complex mechanism to hold “democracy” together.\nHe also mentions the distinction between Anarcho-Capitalism — the market-orient one — and Anarchism-Communism. However, I won’t try to differentiate both of them. I’m just now on the tip of the icerbeg of all that is out there.\nSome names I have to read more are Noam-Chomski, Errico-Malatesta, Peter-Gelderloos."

Take control of what I consume and steer it toward creative output—not obsessively, but in a way that passively expands my worldview.\nI wonder how I can do this better. Is a directory full of text the best way to cultivate new ideas, or just another way to let them fade away?\nI seek a modern approach, though I still value the old ways—they led me here, after all.\nThe question itself is somewhat misframed. Preserving what I consume is never the goal—nor should it be. Wisdom and intelligence don’t come from mere accumulation. Knowledge, maybe. But meaningful progress comes from applying, adapting, and transforming what I’ve learned—regardless of whether the outcome is right or wrong.\nHow can I foster a productive chain of thought that leads to a more rewarding perspective on the world? Not a hedonistic one, but one that is deeply, humanly fulfilling.\nWriting brings me closer to that. So does publishing my ideas. But hoarding? That only creates the illusion of work. The illusion of productivity. And sometimes, even being productive hides in the same shadow.\nBear with me—I’m just beginning to learn.\nI see value in this writing. I also see value in the same thing I dismissed two hours ago. Funny how that works. Every day, things shift—priorities, goals, tools—changing shape and significance. Understanding that brings me closer to myself. Frustration is inevitable; stoicism is my first reflex. Beyond that lies uncharted territory, unique to each of us.\nLearning is repetition—but repetition shouldn’t be forced. You didn’t learn your mother tongue with Anki. The key is to create an environment where repetition happens naturally, where failure isn’t a setback but part of the process. Remove external barriers that prevent this from happening.\nTechnical skills are just one type of useful skill. Sometimes, the mind craves something else."

There is no burden of opening external tools; with just a click of a button, progress is logged. I mostly use Obsidian for managing my second brain, and a feature that I found lacking is the ability to manage multiple repositories within a single vault. The existing (and excellent) obsidian-git plugin does not provide this feature; it focuses on a single repository per vault. With this in mind, I decided it was finally time to create my own plugin to do exactly that.\nDuring my Christmas and New Year break, I built obsidian-git-file-explorer. It is still in the beta stage, but the core functionality is there: enabling easy management of multiple repositories and live changes in the vault. There is still room for optimization. I have never before coded a complete project in TypeScript or JavaScript, and in many ways, I stuck with commonly used object-oriented patterns from Java—the language I am most familiar with—instead of doing things the more functional, canonical JavaScript way. To be honest, I still struggle to read a JS project; I’m not accustomed to how they nest callbacks and apply duck-typing or write functions that ‘just work’ but lack maintainability for someone external to the project. Of course, this is a generalization and entirely my fault due to a lack of experience with the language.\nRant aside, 39 commits later, the plugin is ready. It works. Perhaps not as performantly as it should – in fact – I’d be really happy to accept any PRs helping me improve it."

For each combination of service deviation and context (operational mode, like fully autonomous, and environmental info during operation) a HARA is performed. See Table 1 below.\nA risk monitoring service outputs a result akin to ASIL but for the target domain.\nThey evaluated in a Tractor-Implement-Automation scenario, which is a Reconfiguration scenario where the configuration of the agricultural implement can be changed by the vehicle itself – autonomously.

    "text": "Let us make the distinction between comprehending and knowing.\nKnowing a topic refers to possessing information about it — being aware that it exists. There’s no requirement regarding the depth of understanding — its meaning or applicability.\nComprehending requires deep understanding of a topic — its meaning, implications, and surrounding aspects are well understood.\nComprehension is a much better goal when designing a reading system.\nJust being superficially aware of a topic is not enough for most purposes. We can’t truly discuss such topics; we can only fake a discussion.\nSystems designed for knowledge lack the ability to foster real thinking. Engineering courses, academic programs, and schools are prime examples of what happens when systems are designed for mere knowledge.\nYou end up with information, but it’s disconnected — dangling — with no roots in your existing conceptual base. Any gentle breeze can pull it away. Suddenly, we’re not even aware of it anymore.\nI think about all the concepts I learned during school and engineering; they didn’t stick. At a foundational level, only the things I kept using and was more motivated about endured.\nOne might say that it’s not the job of universities or schools to teach comprehension of these topics. But then — whose job is it? Do we have to figure it out ourselves? We spend so much time in these places — really, a big chunk of our lives — and we’re left with blankness, or at best, a slightly less blank view of reality.\nComprehension is, therefore, key. All meaningful learning systems should have this as their goal."

    "text": "How to foster comprehension in a learning system?\n\nThe limitations of the brain\n\nWe must recognize that we are designing systems for humans — humans with brains, and brains have limitations.\nI’ll base my comparisons on personal experience as a human being learning how to learn. So take this as a critical limitation of the discussion.\nStill, I claim that other brains behave similarly.\nBrains have a limited “comprehension bus factor”: expecting too much comprehension at once often leads to frustration.\nBrains learn only when we add a new concept on top of a well-established base. Adding many dangling concepts at once is, again, a major source of frustration.\nTherefore, concepts should be heavily interconnected.\nSimply regurgitating knowledge is boring. It creates the illusion of comprehension and benefits neither the speaker nor the listener.\nConcepts should be discussed. Through discussion, you discover gaps in your understanding and test the strength of your conceptual roots — where they are strong and where they’re weak.\nBrains are not naturally great at abstract thinking. It’s not that they can’t do it — on the contrary — but I argue that concrete instantiations of knowledge (via examples or mappings) are key to truly understanding something.\n\n\n\nPutting all principles together\n\nA learning system should be designed to maximize discussion of ideas.\nDiscussion is the primary process that generates comprehension.\nThrough discussion, you connect ideas.\nBut merely connecting ideas — as proposed in Active-Ideation — is not the ideal goal.\nAn idea might be linked to thousands of others and still be dangling — barely surviving in our memory.\nThis has happened with many concepts I often relate to others. But the connection is superficial — since neither concept was deeply understood. It becomes a shallow link and sometimes even detrimental, as we see links but can’t recall where they come from.\nNor is recall improvement — as proposed by Progressive-Summarization — an ideal goal.\nI agree that notes should be designed to be recallable by your future self.\nBut this alone doesn’t serve as a good goal for a learning system.\nIt doesn’t differentiate between superficial knowledge and comprehension. Your brain will quickly learn how to game the system — giving you the illusion of comprehension because you’re “doing it right.”\nYou get stuck thinking, “The results will come if I keep doing this every day for years.” But you don’t see them — yet.\nThis falls into the Collector’s Fallacy: you’re conflating the collection of knowledge with comprehension. As we’ve seen, these are very different things.\n\n\n\nA practical example: annotating books and papers\n\nWhat’s the value of a highlight? “To mark the important parts of a text,” you say.\nBut why do that? “So I can remember the important parts.” But how does a highlight actually help with that?\nHere is where the argument starts to fall apart. “If I read the highlight, I’ll remember the key part of the text and won’t need to reread the whole thing!” Wrong. Try it — or maybe you already have. Take a dense paper and highlight the key parts. Do this regularly. You’ll soon find yourself highlighting large blocks of text — because there are so many “key parts” and unknowns you need to revisit later.\nNow return to the text a few weeks later. Did the highlights help you remember the key parts? I doubt it. It’s just a mess.\nHighlights are not for remembering information! Not even close. Don’t be unfair to yourself — acknowledge the limitations of your brain.\nHighlights are, first and foremost, visual cues. “Cues for what?” For marking that a discussion took place. When no discussion happened, no highlight — simple as that.\nIf you return to the text in a week and reread your discussion points instead, you’ll immediately be back where you left off. You’re up to date on the relationship between the text and your more deeply-rooted concepts.\nIf no discussion happened, you didn’t understand the text. That’s the key point.\nIt’s not your job to maintain a comprehensive version of the author’s ideas in your knowledge base. That’s the job of Wikipedia, LLMs, or textbooks.\nYour job is to bring your own perspective into the equation. This aligns with Active-Ideation, but the focus is not just on relationships — it’s on discussions.\n\nDiscussion-is-the-Main-Goal!"

However, it’s difficult to find them unless they come from generational knowledge—the kind of wisdom your parents passed down, which you follow out of habit built over the years.\nA good generational example is waking up early—and, of course, its counterpart, going to sleep early. This simple heuristic translates to improvements in many areas of your life: (1) you have more work time, which increases productivity; (2) you have more hobby time, which boosts happiness; (3) you can see the sun 🌞 early in the morning, which brings numerous health benefits [1]. And these are just the surface-level benefits.\nAnother example that has worked for me—and one I had to learn on my own—is maintaining buffers. Finances can be chaotic, and sometimes you have to pay for unplanned expenses. Part of life is that some taxes or cost centers—like a car—demand lump-sum payments that are hard to foresee. An easy solution is to have a buffer account. Every month, money gets added to it, and any extra funds at the end of the month can also go there. This practice gives every dollar or euro a purpose, another helpful heuristic that isn’t always easy to learn.\nThese measures might seem simplistic or even obvious—as if everyone already does them—but I appreciate them more and more because they bring immense value without much upkeep.\nThey are flexible enough to be domain-independent. The concept of buffers is useful in a multitude of applications: finances, computer science, inventory management, and more. Once you learn and implement them, you feel that a once complex problem has become much more manageable. That peace of mind is priceless.\nI wonder what other helpful (perhaps hidden) heuristics I follow every day without even noticing. I wonder what else is out there that could heavily simplify my life but that I simply haven’t come across or acknowledged."

How can I focus on understanding difficult subjects when my mind and routine are already filled to the brim with other responsibilities? Important ones, yes, but still—other things.\nI find it hard to commit to learning new things, yet I understand the value of doing so. When I do, I feel different, as if I’m seeing the world through clearer lenses.\nOne topic that has fascinated me is philosophy. And this is not a subject where you can cut corners. To engage in the conversation, you must first deeply understand the work that has come before you. Only then can you refine your own assessments and thoughts. They may not be novel, but they certainly belong to a particular epoch of human thinking.\nThat’s what makes getting started so frustratingly hard. To understand what I’m talking about. To be able to contribute something meaningful.\nI don’t want to force an unnatural routine on myself—Anki my way into philosophy. I’m also not nearly smart enough to just pick up Hegel and grasp his ideas on the first read. So far, my approach has been what I’d call soft learning: familiarizing myself with key terms and thinkers, even if just superficially. For that, I’m grateful Philosophize This! exists—a podcast that teaches philosophy chronologically. I’ve gained so much just from understanding the historical context that gave rise to world-changing ideas.\nBut this knowledge hasn’t stuck. It remains a kind of intellectual soup—fluid, fragile, forgettable. There are no existing roots for Kant’s ideas to latch onto. Everything is new. Conceptually new. And I wonder: How do people who aren’t in a classroom actually learn philosophy? I wish there were a clear how-to. Maybe there is.\n\nI found awesome-philosophy. I appreciate the author’s effort, but a list of books alone isn’t enough.\nThis Reddit post seems to tackle the issue more directly. I’ll definitely check it out.\n\nMaybe reading a textbook from an author who can guide me step by step is the best way to approach difficult subjects. The challenge would be making it fit into my routine—reading, reflecting, and distilling my insights into notes.\nI’m still unsure if this is the best method. But I do know that sporadically browsing YouTube, Reddit, or any other site will never be enough for deep understanding. I’m also curious about how language models might be used to teach more effectively. In theory, they could personalize a textbook to your learning style. They could even apply the Socratic method on you—ad nauseam."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Interestingly enough, I already worked on this project in October of 2024. I mentioned a link from Andy-Matuschak where he discussed his naming scheme.\nUnfortunately I didn’t delve much into the topic — and maybe that’s why it came back hunting me today. But let’s jump back to one of Andy’s statements:\nI noticed that I currently don’t do that. I think it could compromise finding the note again in a later moment. And this is a big turn off: if you don’t find the note again, you end up with many notes touching the same problematic but without any connection. A good naming system should also optimize for finding the note again!\nBut that’s not a comprehensive critique of this naming scheme. Not at all. I’ll get back to it eventually.\nAnother technique he mentioned is to use questions as titles (something I also heavily considered). A question forces the need for an answer; and sometimes that’s exactly what we wants. Thus naming notes based on this concept makes sense from the perspective of the outcome we want and the way we think — asking questions, hypotheses and looking up in the answer space is second-nature when are trying to solve a problem.\nOne common realization is that concept notes get us only so far. We need middle ground notes that symbolize their work-in-progress nature — they are thoughts being built or relevant thoughts from others that we want to preserve for future discussions.\nI also don’t think it’s inherently bad if the note has less re-discoverability (is that a word?). It’s okay if some notes only resurface when you are in a given mental state.\nSo the question I ask is which naming rules lead to better thinking? The name of the note is important because it constrains the scope of the note. And the scope we work on constrains the types of connections we can make and the emergent novel thoughts we can potentially make.\nBalancing context is key when designing notes."

    "text": "Notes that enable better thinking\nOn one side we have notes that are clearly bound to a concept, to a reference note, to a day, to a month. There’s no or little ambiguity on how to call them. On the other side, when working on the project of understanding a concept better — the pros, the cons, the historical influx of ideas that shaped it — we want to rely on a set of guidelines to shape it into a serviceable state: one that incentivizes discussion, connection and convolution with our minds.\nI like the idea of writing the strongest context cue first on the title. For a more fleeting note/essay this manifests in the form of a date, or a simplified version of it with just the year and the month — see this note for an example. It elegantly attaches the quality of being “fleeting” to it without tags or any special mechanisms.\n\nAn use case\nTo shape this idea even further I’ll mention the use case of annotating a academic paper — since it’s activity I’m currently doing a lot. I want to be able to put the author’s idea in contrast to other authors; and also preserve it for future instances, in which I want to retrieve this knowledge.\nFor that I am often relying on implicit indexes: if the given reference contributes to a new challenge for a given topic, I link it to a note called “Challenges of [topic]”. I call it implicit index because the indexation is happening implicitly, via backlinks: if I want to retrieve the whole mapping I go this “challenges” note and see all its backlinks.\nI like this; it’s flexible enough and I’m not repeating myself.\nSo from here we start to see the emergence of a new type of note. It’s not a concept per se, but it is a research about this topic.\nThey’re researches in their simplest form: state of art researches. Naming them is straightforward: I see the pattern emerging of combining a strong noun with a topic. Another example is Use cases for [topic].\nThere’s two aspects of a research that are relevant: the backlinks — who is contributing to and using this research; and its content: which patterns emerge from it? Which other sub-researches emerge from it? And here it becomes evident its “open-ended” nature. We will hardly know if the research is completely resolved — of course, sometimes it’s possible; however, more often than not, the best we could do is give our best shot based on what we currently know.\nThey are not everlasting: Researches are fluid!"

Even the research question behind it can change and even become stale, obsolete, get refined, get expanded.\nA new contribution can come and completely change your understanding and previous notion/answer to it. And this is by design. Therefore, a good system for representing them should also consider its fluid nature.\nBut how to name them?\nAs discussed, for simpler notes the pattern of a strong noun + topic can be helpful. However, for the vast majority of research questions we need a bit more variety in the expression. Fact is that I am still learning how to do it well. I still haven’t converged into an adequate method for doing that; oftentimes I name it as questions — closely resembling the research question, with hows, whats and so on; in others I think a statement fits better.\nMaybe this lack of consistency is not entirely bad. But it’s a consequence of how this particular research is more commonly expressed out of there. Nevertheless, this is still an open topic to me."

I like that these notes can be naturally used mid sentences due to the natural way it’s formulated.\nMore broader than that, I argue for creating notes for every discussion-worthy claim. If a note is strong, then it’s helpful to extract in its own note. You might even bind the reference as its main context like “[claim] by [author], [year]”.\nTo help contain the messier nature of having multiple notes, it’s helpful to use Indexes or Outline-Notes."

Refer to the picture below to find the problem.\nFirst assess the current state: put capo in the 1st fret and a finger in any fret where the neck is already in contact with the guitar frame. You want to use the string as a reference straight line and ignore other parameters as nut height and action.\nSlide a business card between fret and lowest string around the 7th fret\nYou want the thickness of the card to be the distance between fret and string; so if it slides too loosely, then you may have backwards bow; conversely, if it is too tight, forward bow. Compare with the pic, does the problem matches the measurement? (idk about 7+ strings guitars, I tried to do this procedure measuring with the 6th string, ignoring the 7th, and it worked nicely)\nNow find the trust rod adjustment nut. In my guitar it was in the headstock, covered by a piece of plastic. Pick the correct allen key and do adjustments in 1/8th of a turn, as the pic suggests.\nRemember to always retune the guitar for the correct tension to be there. The tension impacts relief, so you need it to be there, in order for the measurement to make any sense.\n\n\n\n\nmaxresdefault\n\n\n2024-05-04 Currently moving clockwise (reference plane with normal headstock -&gt; bridge) (suspecting forward bow)"

Personally, I don’t measure it at all. Let me tell you why.\nFind these guys in your bridge:\n\n\n\nUnbenannt\n\n\nThere are two of them for each string. It suppose it should follow the curvature of the neck. So whenever you are adjusting them, try to do your best to adjust the same amount on both of them. This is easy to do. Just put the key and make a mental note where it is, adjust in quarter/half or full turns and just replicate on the other nut.\nI tend to leave them the lowest possible, before I start hearing any fret buzz. For the lowest strings I leave them a bit higher, so they can have more sustain."

    "text": "I became suddenly interested in how Beluga whales gained their Melon — this bulbous, gelatinous part on the top of their head. It’s so weird, I had no idea about its function!\nTurns it out it’s used for communication and Echolocation. It contains fats of different densities which uses a phenomena known as Refraction to bend the wave and focalize into a beam. Refraction happens when a sound wave passes between two mediums that affect the speed of the wave differently.\nLet’s take sound waves passing from the air to the water: the speed increases in the water, since water is denser and thus molecules of water can bounce into each other more easily than the ones in the air — in the air they are space out.\nBut swap the sound wave to a light wave and the behavior is the opposite: light travels slowers in water. This happens because water scatters the rays as they travel, opposed to the usually straight path they do in vacuum or air — although in air there’s still scattering but less pronounced.\nA small trivia about this last fact: this gives rise to orange-y, red-y sunsets, since light of different wavelengths are scattered with varying levels: red-sh waves are longer and are more resistant to scattering, blu-sh ones are shorter and thus bump more easily into dust, water vapor or things that can scatter them.\nComing back to refraction, if the difference between mediums is big enough and the waves comes in steep in relation to the normal of the interface between them, Total Reflexion can happen. Instead of the wave entering the new medium with a change in its angle it bounces back to the same medium — like a rubber ball thrown onto the ground at an angle.\nCool. We covered the first part of my obsession of the last three days. The second part is how this gelatinous thing evolved in the first place. Beyond just the Beluga’s melon, I was interested in how these highly-specialized organs evolve in the first place: it must had no purpose when it first started appearing due to a random mutation.\nOne possibility is that a limited proto-version of the organ showed up and the trait got passed forward since it didn’t harm the individual’s fitness. It was just there — and suddenly because of environmental changes it got used for the first time. Now the selection happens in the standard way we are used to: the fittest ‘melons’ got passed forward, since it provided critical advantages for survival. Therefore, it could have been once a Neutral-Mutation.\nI just looked online for other possibilities and was baffled to find a contra-evolution christian website citing dolphin’s melon as an example of a complex structure impossible to have evolved step-by-step. It cites Sarfati, 1999:\n\nFor such an organ to have evolved, random mutations must have formed the right enzymes to make the lipids to be deposited in the right places and shape.  A gradual step-by-step evolution of the organ is not feasible, because until the lipids were fully formed and at least partly in the right place and shape, they would have been of no use.  Therefore, natural selection would not have favored incomplete intermediate forms.”\n\nAt first it makes sense to refute evolution of features that doesn’t lead to a better survival of the individual also in the incremental evolutionary stages. However, it could have been there as a proto-version — not harming the fitness — and some individual had the bare minimum of mutations necessary for it use for echolocation, even if rudimentary. This would have lend the individual an advantage, making it better at passing the genes forward. Why couldn’t this be an explanation? It seems possible.\nOr it could be an example of Exaptation: the melon could have served (or still serve) a purpose different than echolocation. It evolved because it improved the individual’s buoyancy for example — and it turned out it could be used for echolocation as well."

Learning about a forest, for example, may lead to deeper inquiry into trees, leaves, or, even more complexly, the animals living there. Everything is open to deeper understanding, but knowing when to stop subdividing or when to explore the breadth of related concepts is a difficult skill to develop.\nMuch of my writing touches on this problem: How can I navigate this body of knowledge while remaining sane and still achieving productive results? There must be at least some degree of systematic organization. At the same time, care must be taken not to overdo it—too much system, too much framework, and it begins to hinder research itself.\nOne approach I find particularly useful is thinking through writing. The process of composing an essay helps me clarify my thoughts and identify misconceptions or gaps in my understanding. I call this approach Essay-based Learning: writing small, opinionated essays that synthesize my current understanding of a topic. These are not just Wikipedia-like descriptions of concepts but rather focused pieces addressing specific research questions. Less formal than an academic article, yet structured enough to serve as a foundation for one."

Every of them deserves a survey by its own merit — since it’s extremely difficult to survey all of them at once, based on a broad, general query.\nThe main consequence of this approach is a more interconnected research, relying on backlinks.\nI still don’t have a good solution for the ingestion process: Continuous-Research, the collection of methods I compiled for maintaining and expanding knowledge, is lacking in this regard.\n\nIn particular, I tend to lose focus. I’m reading a piece, and suddenly I’m caught in another topic — almost a requirement for me to move forward in the original goal.\nWhat I end up having is many researches that, at least, overlap, and more often than I would like to admit, are completely redundant.\n\nAnother challenge I currently have is linking researches with references.\n\nFor each piece of reference I read, I write a note that’s referenceable to a \\(Bib\\TeX\\) item by its citekey. There I add my notes and highlights.\nOften a reference contributes to a research and I keep asking myself the same question “should I add a related-work-like summary into the research or not?” If yes, what about Dont-Repeat-Yourself? What about a possible desync. between ref and the research?\nI know, I know. It’s stupid, but that’s where my brain goes. This generates friction and stresses me out.\n\nI also would like to keep working on research dumps — public pages that summarizes what I did during the month.\n\nI hate that this new approach (more segregated researches) lead me to just linking this file with many non-public researches. They are not public, because they are mess of citations, half-baked thoughts.. simply not ready for someone to read!\n\nI’m working on this paper: The Role of Dynamic Risk Management in Flexible Production Systems\n\nThis page is currently not available for the public. The reason is that it is a big mess at the current state.\nI’m also afraid of misunderstanding an author’s work deeply. Even if it’s a preprint, I want to keep a high-enough standard of publication.\nHowever, I’m thinking about how to deploy incremental preprints of my work (is this a thing?)\nAlso: now I clearly stated my focus: I want to understand DRM for flexible production systems (still unsure about the precise term to use)"

It reflects my view of the project and my personal interpretation of the chaos surrounding it. Notes serve as my personal breadcrumbs, reminding me where I left off and with what difficulties—often the reason I started in the first place.\nA project within the company I work for – one involving a team with artifacts, Kanban boards, sprints, and processes– can only be managed sanely through having my own perspective/view. My repository represents my interests and aids me in understanding what I am working on. In this repository, everything is a file.\nA new issue becomes a file there. A new meeting also gets its own file. An internal process receives its own document as well. Drawing from Unix principles and their derivatives, this approach has proven more relevant than I initially anticipated. Files are manageable units that ideally have high cohesion within themselves. They help me store thoughts and make sense of the world around me.

Just intaking information does not do any good; this is the realization I come to over and over again.\nI want to contribute meaningfully to the world. Contribute to technologies that I’m convinced will change the world. I find the area of safe autonomous systems essential for this — and I can only do a good work here if I think out of the box. Emergent ideas.\nSo my systems should foment the creation of emergent ideas. I don’t want to make this piece a piece about how to achieve this, since the answer is still unclear to me. I do however think that I made some progress during these couple weeks.\nI realized I put so much weight on details: On naming notes is the living prove. Of course, working on this project involve exploring the whole field of possibilities; nothing wrong here. However, experience has shown to me, that if you just work on a project — let it kneed itself — you will end up on systems that conformed best (or best enough) to the task at the hand.\nBest in this case is heavily debatable. Normally what ends up happening is most friction points are filed out; if there’s an allowed path of least resistance it’ll get chosen eventually. And this is my grand master plan behind researching: I have to do it long enough. It’s okay, it’s fine if everything is slow, sometimes redundant in this first stage. Let it sit and do it long enough. You will find what works and what not.\nNevertheless, this can only work if the optimization goals are clear from the start. These are (1) ideate and discuss: see the gaps and generate novel solutions for standing research questions; and (2) extract artifacts: a repository build in such a way that you can just “pluck” articles, posts or any deliverable. It should benefit from compound effects — pay us interest.\nI just want to get these goals right from the start. As long what I am doing are aligned with that and my gut feeling say that what I am doing is correct, then keep it. If I have a hunch that something can be improved or would lead to a goal being deviated: discuss it. Write about, remember Writing is Thinking.\nI guess this is what I wanted to hear, since I got a mind-freeing feeling after writing this. The task at hand is daunting. It’s enormous and open-endend: I understand why it can be overwhelming. However, you have implemented a system that is already providing utility; and you have also a support net if things go south."

Plus, non-text assets don’t benefit much from version control; they don’t leverage Git’s strengths.\nLooking for alternatives, I found that Git LFS (Large File Storage) could solve some of these issues. It essentially offloads large files to a separate server, replacing them in Git with lightweight pointers. It’s well-integrated with major Git hosting platforms and works seamlessly with the CLI. Best of all, it wouldn’t require any major changes to my workflow.\nHowever, after setting it up, I quickly hit a roadblock: GitHub’s quota limits. Within a day, I received an email notifying me that I had exceeded the 1GB free bandwidth limit. The only solution? Buy additional data in 50GB increments.\nI don’t want another recurring expense, especially for something as simple as storing images. But without a solid Plan B, I started exploring alternatives."

I approach this from a software engineering perspective: extract out the public aspects.\nI started developing a game and had to overcome certain limitations with the framework I was using. Although I don’t see the game becoming open-source anytime soon, I definitely see potential in the framework-specific solutions I developed during the process. These solutions can easily be turned into 1-2 libraries that could benefit many others.\nThere is also a significant personal benefit: getting to know people, understanding their issues, learning new approaches, and solving problems I hadn’t considered before.

The equation is straightforward: if the value a tool provides outweighs the added complexity, it’s worth using. The challenge lies in measuring both value and complexity. But in cases like this, the brain often finds a quick answer—manifesting as intuition.

That’s where Readwise excels: by sending daily digests that resurface past insights.\nSo, if there’s one tool I would subscribe to, it would be one that generates digests from my markdown notes—aggregating them into a gentle, well-timed invitation to review and reflect."

For some reason, it’s really popular in Germany – maybe someone over there can clue me in as to why? [2]\n\nWhy is it popular on the country that a service sends you 3 letters just for you to be able to log in in their app? No clue haha\nAnd it’s archived since 2021. It provides the workflow with the printer/scanner I wanted by it scanning to a FTP server – with the requirement that the scanner should also support this option.\nFrom their GitHub [1] I came across Mayan [2] which is actively maintained. But it seems really bulky and more aimed at enterprise users, at least this was my first impression.\n\n\nDocspell\nDocspell [3] seems nice. It supports these kinds of automated workflows by means of a NLP library. Let me look in the issues.\n\nI’ve just toyed around with the latest llamafile release and I have to say: I think we are at the point where it starts to be feasible to have a LLM running locally for auto tagging on import. – [1, Issue 1996]\n\nThis is interesting. A LLM service would kind of solve the issue, wouldn’t it? Just a simple file server and a local LLM extracting tags and description would suffice. In respect to that (1) I have no idea about the quality gain of an workflow with just LLM and one using NLP; and (2) my server is weak to run LLMs locally – and I don’t want sensitive letters becoming part of a training data set. Also, a LLM+file server-based workflow would cost me way more time to implement decently. Thus, it makes more sense to go with an off-the-shelf solution.\nIt supports different ingestion workflows, e.g. documents send to an e-mail folder are automatically processed. So the scanner must support sending e-mails. A CLI is also provided with utilities like watching a folder for new documents and automatically picking them for processing. This is excellent.\nIt also provides the option to store the files directly in the FS – no DB. This is also good to have if I don’t want to manage an extra service for the database. From what I understood I can just use the FS as file backend and an H2 file as metadata backend. Exactly what I was looking for."

Use smartly structured tasks and choose one actionable step to focus on.\nCreate a new file in your favorite text editor (or an analog notebook) and clearly write down the task you intend to complete during this WS.\nIf the task is large, break it into smaller, manageable chunks—Divide-and-Conquer!\nMost importantly, ensure that each task has a crystal-clear endpoint.\n\n\n2. Work\nThis is the step you’re familiar with, but with one important addition: logging.\nIn the same file where you wrote your task, document what you’re working on, any obstacles you encounter, insights you gain, and any other relevant details. Keep the bar low—if something seems even mildly relevant, jot it down. You’ll thank yourself later.\nLogging your work:\n\nCreates a record of your progress.\nReinforces the value of your efforts.\nEnhances traceability, helping you track the challenges you faced and the solutions you applied.\n\nConsider these scenarios:\n\nBoss: “What did you accomplish last month?” You: A few clicks away from the answer.\n\n\nYou, six months later: “What was I doing in this hobby project again?” A few clicks away from the answer.\n\n\nYou, after reading your notes: “Oh! I got stuck here last time. Now I know exactly where to pick up and move forward!”\n\n\n\n3. Long Pause\nOnce the WS is over, you deserve a long break. Be kind to yourself—if you need a few extra minutes, take them. However, before ending your WS, ensure that your task is either:\n\nCompleted, or\nReplanned for a future session.\n\nSince you’re actively logging, you’ll have a clear sense of whether your current WS is enough to complete the task. If not, take a few minutes to revise and break it down further. This is completely normal—over time, you’ll develop a better sense of what can realistically be achieved in a WS."

Because going forward is what shapes you. An endpoint and future may not exist; forget about them. There’s no proof of the existence of past or future, so don’t take their reality for granted.\nOnly the act of moving forward matters. And this movement lacks structure.

    "text": "I want to talk about what makes a piece of culture bad. Alice-in-the-Borderland, for example: bad, yet disguised within a concept I’m a sucker for.\nI believe it’s the same phenomenon I observed while watching Attack-on-Titan, The-Platform, and The-Cube. Really captivating premises, but much feels off. It’s as if the way characters behave almost never aligns with what the viewer expects — and we slowly get used to it. Eventually, this strangeness is incorporated into our expectations. Not only is this off-putting, but subsequent moments further exacerbate the problem.\nThe uniqueness of the concepts taps into a mysterious part of my brain that compels me to keep watching. And then I continue watching only to satisfy the desire to see the concept explored to its end — to see what the authors and directors came up with. But this doesn’t make a show good. It’s primal, too primal; the substance isn’t there.\nBy “substance,” I mean a coherent story. One that tells itself — without relying on (what I consider) lazy narrative devices like flashbacks and long monologues. A good story isn’t afraid to surprise us — by breaking expectations. We anticipate something, but it doesn’t happen. That’s the surprise.\nWhat happens next is what’s decisive.\nGame-of-Thrones, especially the early seasons, excels here. You witness character development, and soon you get used to having your expectations broken again and again. But you’re not confused when Lord Frey acts as he does during the Red Wedding. From a humane perspective, it’s shocking; but from a narrative one, it makes perfect sense. The story caught us off guard, but it added up. We could interpolate Lord Frey’s behavior and justify it internally.\nContrast that with Alice in Borderland — a prime example of a strong concept executed poorly. Think Squid Game but on a larger scale and with anime aesthetics. Players must compete in games to earn “life visas” to survive. And maybe I’m being unfair — perhaps “they’re just acting like they did in the manga.” But an adaptation faces a choice: blandly port the original, or make it shine in its new form. They chose the former.\nThere’s a disturbing lack of questions when there should be more. A lack of reaction when there should be some. Cultural differences? Maybe. But the more I think about it, the less satisfying it feels to blame the acting. I wanted the concept to work — not just as an idea, but in the realm of narrative expectations. I wanted the story to be good.\nTo be fair, I loved some aspects. I like how anime often provides structure to abstract ideas. This show uses a clever system: each game has a playing card that indicates both difficulty and type. A 4 of Hearts is a difficulty-4 emotional game. It’s intuitive, shareable, and opens space for fan speculation and invention. A clear win.\nAnd the Beach — a hedonist cult mandating swimsuits — was brilliant. Conceptually, it’s chef’s kiss. But lore-wise and acting-wise? Disaster. Every game ends in the last possible second. Throwaway characters blurt dumb, expository lines: “No… it can’t be… They are manipulating us—” Of course they are, dumbfuck! You’re in some alternate dimension playing lethal games, and now you realize this? And you shout it in front of everyone?\nAnd the protagonist — the most textbook depiction of a nerdy gamer. Alienated father, golden-boy brother, self-doubt. So predictable it hurts.\nThen they decide to chase after suspicious cars — not sneakily, just outright sprinting down an empty street. The best part? It kind of works…? Until they get caught five minutes later near the enemy base, after a dramatic little chat. That might’ve been the most believable moment in the whole thing.\nSeriously, what?\nThis Narrative-Dissonance — between promising premise and broken execution — highlights a recurring flaw in certain speculative fiction: the idea alone is compelling, but the narrative architecture collapses under scrutiny. Good stories must do more than dangle a mystery or provoke a primal hook; they must earn trust through consistent internal logic and character integrity. No amount of clever framing or aesthetic flourish can substitute for the absence of story."
