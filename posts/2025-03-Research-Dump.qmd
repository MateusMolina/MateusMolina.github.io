## Problem statement

1. I started researching the topic of runtime safety management of Machine Learning (ML) components as a PhD candidate at the RPTU.
2. They are often a black box with low understandability. This leads to variable uncertainty during the runtime.
3. Current Risk-Assessment processes relies on worst-case operational assumptions made on the design phase
4. Therefore we need a way to make the shift of certain aspects of Safety-Assurance to runtime. See Risk-Assessment-at-Runtime

## Currently doing

1. Reading the previous work from the commonly cited researchers in the field
2. Reviewing relevant terminology, standards and concepts
3. Mapping conferences, workshops, journals
4. 2025-03-The-Roles-of-Uncertainty-Risk-and-Hazard-in-Dynamic-Assessment
5. [Essay-based-Learning](Essay-based-Learning.qmd)
6. 2025-03-Safety-Assurance-of-RMS

## Reading list

### Haupt and Liggesmeyer, 2019

Paper: @Haupt2019166

1. Autonomous-Systems operating in an unknown, dynamic and unstructured safety-critical environment requires different techniques for Safety-Assurance.
2. The paper's contribution is a rule-based runtime safety monitoring component that observes system's deviations
3. In the design phase the system is decomposed in its services -- borrowing from SOA -- is able to perform. For each combination of _service deviation_ and context (operational mode, like fully autonomous, and environmental info during operation) a HARA is performed. See Table 1 below.
4. A risk monitoring service outputs a result akin to ASIL but for the target domain.
5. They evaluated in a Tractor-Implement-Automation scenario, which is a Reconfiguration scenario where the configuration of the agricultural implement can be changed by the vehicle itself -- autonomously. This is really cool. Similar to I4.0.

### Patel and Liggesmeyer, 2021

Paper: @patelMachineLearningBased2021

1. He is using Support Vector Machine to implement Dynamic-Risk-Assessment at runtime for the Autonomous-Vehicles domain. "DRA-SVM"
2. SVM is a Supervised-Learning technique, therefore he needed to manually select the features to be monitored
3. His model gets as input the vehicle status data (acceleration, braking) and outputs Severity and Controllability rating
4. It was validated using an Adaptive-Cruise-Control CARLA simulation. Both training and test data also come from the simulation. So theoretical applicability only.
5. He mentions as future work the possible addition of a decision-making component that gets the outputs from his model and makes the decision of, I guess, reducing speed or braking.

### Hartsell et al., 2021

Paper: @hartsellReSonAteRuntimeRisk2021

1. RESONATE uses probabilistic models and conditional relationships derived from the BTD formalism to dynamically assess the risk in a situation -- not quite rule-based.
2. It takes information from monitoring systems — which can be ML components — and sensor information
3. It relies on an extended BTD with probability information -- output from the design phase
4. The component in the current form only outputs likelihood and _not_ _severity_
5. _Uncertainty_ is _also_ not an output of RESONATE

### Reich and Trapp, 2020

Paper: @reichSINADRAFrameworkAssurable2020

1. SINADRA is a framework encompassing risk analysis in both the design phase and runtime
2. Design phase includes synthesis of the runtime model
3. Main contribution is to get Residual-Risk at the runtime; claims previous work didn’t do that
4. Runtime model is a Bayesian-Network (BN) — therefore, model based — which get the intended EGO behaviour as input and outputs Residual-Risk + Uncertainty. This data can then be consumed by a decision making component -- and then redirected to a Proactive-Risk-Control component e.g.
5. No evaluation is given
6. Explicit handling of uncertainty—from perception through to risk assessment
7. Similar to Patel, but Patel outputs Severity + Likelihood, if I'm not mistaken
8. Safety assurance is a key challenge; paper outlines the need to integrate the synthesis of the BN models into a systematic safety engineering process

### Kläes et al., 2021

Paper: @klaesHandlingUncertaintiesDataDriven2021

1. They are applying Uncertainty-Wrappers -- additional models that enrich a DDM with Uncertainty information -- in a DRM framework
2. They implemented an RSS validation scenario, in which the friction is considered to be dynamic and a source of uncertainty for estimating the Safe Distance.

### Ertle et al., 2012

Paper: @ertleUtilizingDynamicHazard2012

1. They use a database of Safety-Principles -- specific known hazard causes -- to assess risks.
	1. They mentioned the example of a plastic spoon approaching a burning candle. Toxic vapors evolve and the or the spoon starts to burn.
	2. Therefore, one can conclude that heated plastic material can -- they use _always_ here, but I'm not so sure -- generate toxic vapor or starts to burn.
2. The use case is an autonomous robot driving in a production plant. Every second (1Hz) they perform the process of (1) gathering environment data, (2) building the action plan -- the set of the possible movement outcomes, (3) performing the Risk-Assessment with the method described in 1 and (4) executing the plan. (See Fig 1 for a really badly-drawn schematic)

### Leite et al.

Papers: @leiteSafetyAssuranceAutonomous2017, @leite2018dynamic, @leite2019dynamic

1. the paper extends the previous work @leiteSafetyAssuranceAutonomous2017 by implementing a runtime risk assessment approach for autonomous and cooperative MCPS
2. Configurations are certified at design-time and attributed a SIL to dynamic decision-making.
3. For their use case -- Patient-Controlled-Analgesia -- smart alarm and automated interventions can be realized. The challenge is the insufficient context awareness and a lack of reasoning capabilities to deduce the current risk.
4. each configuration, pre-certified with a ConSert Tree Tree, is monitored in real time
5. Combined with ConSerts, it's possible to continuously check the matching between current top-level Safety-Guarantees of the MCPS -- Which can be subjected to Reconfiguration -- and the current top-level safety requirement on the other.
	1. That means, (1) we can go from the selected configuration -- which is specified during design time -- and (2) analyze if the Safety-Guarantees are sufficient -- which can be provided by ConSerts.
	2. I wonder what is the corresponding term of Safety Guarantee from ISO 26262?
6. A Bayesian-Network is used to calculate a configuration-dependent risk metric based on sensor data and expert-defined parameters

### Laxman et al.

Papers: @laxman2020u-map

1. Proposes a reference map -- U-map -- for handling uncertainties.
2. It maps uncertainties with Hazards -- which then can be mapped to Safety-Measures
3. Development of the U-map happens in the design phase.
4. A probabilistic model Bayesian-Network was used for runtime update
5. It mentions the possibility of the map being used as knowledge base for frameworks like MAPE-K feedback loops with the goal of analyzing the uncertainty and executing identified mitigation steps.
6. The use case presented was a production scenario where e.g. a mobile robot can be a hazard for a human.

### Schneider et al.

Papers: @schneiderDynamicRiskManagement2024

Papers: @schneider2010conditional, @schneiderApproachingRuntimeTrust2011

1. Conditional Safety Certificates (ConSerts) are introduced to facilitate Dynamic-Risk-Assessment.
	1. ConSerts map safety property types of required and provided services
	2. Specified in boolean logic similarly to CFTs -- with gates and direct edges.
	3. Allows associating runtime evidence to safety guarantees, which are associated with a SIL
	4. I feel I need a more concrete example to better understand this concept
2. Contributes to ideas of utilizing ConSerts to Support Trust
3. Why Conserts don't support trust by default and must be extended?
	1. Because they don't support trust certificates -- considering security _and_ the full spectrum of dependability -- target for them is mostly safety, whereas dependability also involve availability and reliability.

## On beginning the PhD with a survey

1. It doesn't matter if I end up doing a SLR or not; I have to start reading systematically. That means, finding the gist of the paper and seeing the context, the assumptions, the pros and cons. See the paper in the big picture.
2. I should start cataloguing what I'm reading.
3. Create a new note with a set of questions that _must_ be answered for every paper being analyzed in the context of my research.

## Dependability issue: global and project-specific notes

1. It's often the case for a given reference -- a paper for instance -- I analyze it in its own note in my main vault but need to refine or enrich it with additional information.
2. This additional information is often _project-specific_ and undesirable in a more generic context -- which is the case of my main vault.
3. How can I add new notes to a project that reference the global note? So I don't repeat myself and still maintain consistency during an analysis?
4. I think the concept of parent note might be handy. This parent note can be linked in the metadata of the child note as: `parent: example-parent-note` -- here assuming a wikilink format.
5. Just for the context I plan to apply this for the following workflow:
	1. I create a new global note for a reference -- let us assume a conference paper. There we add all relevant metadata of the publication _and_ my general remarks and notes about it (often answers for what/why/how/weaknesses/future work)
	2. In a separated vault/repository -- where I am performing a literature review -- I create a new note which references the global note through the _parent_ property, as described in 4.
	3. In this new note I add the survey-relevant (or more abstractly, project-specific) information.

## Thoughts on executing a SLR

1. Instead of blindly digesting all papers, one by one, I could apply a smarter approach:
2. Sort by last author -- this is normally the head researcher. That way I sort by the research group. Then apply a sort by first author. Digest together all papers of the research group grouped by first author.
3. This makes understanding the evolution of the thought-process inside a research grouper easier. Furthermore, it's easier for me to digest and process ideas that are correlated and/or are built on top of the previously defined concepts.
