title: Preserving what I consume
---

Read. Watch. Sense. Take control of what I consume and steer it toward creative output—not obsessively, but in a way that passively expands my worldview.

I wonder how I can do this better. Is a directory full of text the best way to cultivate new ideas, or just another way to let them fade away?

I seek a modern approach, though I still value the old ways—they led me here, after all.

The question itself is somewhat misframed. Preserving what I consume is never the goal—nor should it be. Wisdom and intelligence don’t come from mere accumulation. Knowledge, maybe. But meaningful progress comes from applying, adapting, and transforming what I’ve learned—regardless of whether the outcome is right or wrong.

How can I foster a productive chain of thought that leads to a more rewarding perspective on the world? Not a hedonistic one, but one that is deeply, humanly fulfilling.

Writing brings me closer to that. So does publishing my ideas. But hoarding? That only creates the illusion of work. The illusion of productivity. And sometimes, even being productive hides in the same shadow.

Bear with me—I’m just beginning to learn.

I see value in this writing. I also see value in the same thing I dismissed two hours ago. Funny how that works. Every day, things shift—priorities, goals, tools—changing shape and significance. Understanding that brings me closer to myself. Frustration is inevitable; stoicism is my first reflex. Beyond that lies uncharted territory, unique to each of us.

Learning is repetition—but repetition shouldn’t be forced. You didn’t learn your mother tongue with Anki. The key is to create an environment where repetition happens naturally, where failure isn’t a setback but part of the process. Remove external barriers that prevent this from happening.

Technical skills are just one type of useful skill. Sometimes, the mind craves something else.
