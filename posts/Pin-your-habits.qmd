title: Pin your habits

The concept of taking note whenever you are about to do a good or a bad habit.

Mindfully observing your feelings, sensorial inputs and circumstances that triggered this behaviour provides information and reduces influences of automatized and heavily-ingrained neural pathways in place.

Ask yourself:

- What led me to wanting to do this bad habit?
- How am I feeling right now? Bored? Agitated? Anxious?
- Where am I?
- What I did just before wanting to do this bad habit?

Logging these instances provide a way to recognize patterns that often lead to the bad behaviour.

When the pattern is there, the target is clear. One way to mitigate is to apply the concept of TAPs
